Every block is a set of 256 code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane,
shaded by how often each character is used. Click on a block to zoom
in and view character representations. Click again to zoom out.

This is a visualization of character frequency in OpenStreetMap.
The set of characters shown, the Basic Multilingual Plane, is a subset of the
full Unicode range, but the most commonly used part for languages in use.
The data is generated by taking the 'name' attribute of every node
in the OpenStreetMap planet and running each code point through a simple
Go utility to generate usage statistics.

<p>
A few interesting areas:
</p>
<p>The bottom right corner houses the Halfwidth
and Fullwidth forms which are very common in Korea as an alternative way of
typing English letters.
</p>
<p>
'e' is the most commonly occurring character in the set.
</p>
<p>CJK occupies the
entire middle range.
